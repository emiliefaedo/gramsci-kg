**Title**: 
The microcosm of the subalterns: elements for thinking about brazilian subalternity. Abstract: The contemporary elaborations of Antonio Gramsci's thought, considered a classic Marxist theorist, provide an undoubted contribution to the critical understanding of today's sociopolitical issues related, for example, to the production and reproduction of hegemonic class domination, as well as subalternity in its diverse and complex dimensions. Regarding the present research proposal, what is intented is to advance in the philological understanding of the categorical pair subalternity/hegemony. More specifically, to study the development of the methodological criteria about subalternity, thematizing it in an intersectional approach of class domination, race and gender in Brazil. Taking the hypothesis that subalternity is produced by hegemonic domination and, therefore, the history of subalterns is episodic, sometimes disaggregated, but, despite of this, there are movements and â€œmolecular ruptures'' that cannot be disregarded, on the contrary, must be studied, disseminated and expanded. Thus, a set of preliminary questions is presented to guide the research problem: does the notion of subalternity, developed by Gramsci, can be considered as a new concept of class? Who are the subalterns in Gramsci's work? And in Brazil? Who are they and how to study the subalterns in thematization with the Brazilian reality? And for what? Methodologically, what is proposed is a philological reconstruction of the term, and, in an exercise of translatability, to advance in the investigation of the particularities of Brazilian subalternity, in its contours as a country of dependent capitalism and in the uniqueness of its subordinate social groups, inserted in the hegemonic struggle. And, to organize the representation of the problematic, a knowledge graph will be produced, as an open educational resource, of the publications on Gramscian thought in Brazil, with emphasis on the subalternity and hegemony categories. 

**Key-words**: 
Antonio Gramsci, subalternity, hegemony, knowledge graph. 

**Main goal**: 
Thematizing the Gramscian notion of subalternity in an intersectional approach of class domination, race and gender in Brazil, especially about the methodological possibilities of studying the subalterns. 

**Specific objectives**: 
- Philologically study the theme of subalternity in the author's prison work.
- Politically thematize the need to study subalternity, in relation to the notion of hegemony.
- Know and develop methodological perspectives for the study of subordinates/subalternity.
- Investigate the particularities of Brazilian subalternity, the relationship of Brazil as a nation in globalized (dependent) capitalism and the formation of historically reproduced subaltern social groups.
- Develop and publish a knowledge graph of publications related to Gramscian thought in Brazil, with specific emphasis on references that address the themes of subalternity and hegemony.
